              why do you think it&apos;s so hard to focus on school?
            </p>

            <p className="party-two">
              I feel like you don&apos;t even need to go as general as &quot;school&quot;... sometimes it can be hard to just focus on this specific task that you have to do which may be unrelated to school
            </p>

            <p className="party-one">
              true, but at the same time, it sometimes feels like the inability to focus on something has to do with the domain in which those specific things you&apos;re trying to focus on exists
              <br /><br />
              like, I love reading research, I love going on rabbit-hole deep dives of certain interests, although that drive would have to be externally induced when researching for writing essays in English HL... I love learning abstract concepts and experimenting with putting them it in practice through, say, technical projects, but after understanding high-level math concepts in math 101, and that even only motivated by some vague curiosity, I feel so little motivation (feels like I&apos;m being demotivated in some respects) to practice those skills by using them to solve some weird rational integral with a bunch of euler numbers raised to x with even more powers on top
            </p>

            <p className="party-two">
              well I feel like that&apos;s a common sentiment: there are just certain things that interest you, and other things that don&apos;t. and what interests you, you&apos;re a self-starter in, and pursuing what doesn&apos;t feels like a waste of time. 
              <br/><br/>
              like, learning mathematics and data science for modeling and analysis for use in trading in the markets to make money vs solving jupiter notebook course assignments or for to answer questions on a final exam are wildly different motivators
            </p>
            
            <p className="party-one">

              yes... I feel that that interplay between interest and motivation can be more nuanced
              <br/><br />
              maybe I&apos;m just overthinking in a narrow domain, exploring the infinity between two numbers, but this insane struggle I&apos;m facing w/ motivating myself for school makes me think there&apos;s more to this

            </p>

            <p className="party-two">
              perhaps the struggle is only insane because of a specific environment you&apos;re in: the dissonance between where you want to go vs the effort required to continue some set path that you&apos;re implicitly travelling, typically the path of academia {`->`} degree {`->`} job, is insanely large, larger than it was before
              <br/><br />
              like in highschool, the effort required to graduate with decent grades was negligible so you really could do whatever you wanted to do, but that effort increases in postsecondary... and you&apos;re not smart enough and/or not conscientious/industrious enough to continue living two lives
              <br/><br />
              would anyone really be smart enough? perhaps a good combination of intelligence and conscientiousness would allow that path for a few. but ik ur lazy.

            </p>

            <p className="party-one">
              yeah, I&apos;m pretty lazy
            </p>

            <p className="party-two">
              well, more precisely you have a very asymmetrical relationship with domains that interest you vs all other domains, and the amount of effort you put into them
            </p>

            <p className="party-one">
              then perhaps this discourse is on the level of, or should really be dealing with, how do you rectify the growing separation between two desires? two visions?
            </p>

            <p className="party-two">
              yeah. maybe a question to ask is, what is the reasoning, the why, for the desires. and another good question to ask is, from what emotional response do those desires come from?
            </p>

            <p className="party-one">
              I think one desire I&apos;ve always had was to be free to explore the world creatively. explore not necessarily via &quot;travelling the world&quot;, although that can always be good, but explore by taking the freedom to look at the world in different ways--be free to think, well, freely about the world, read a lot of books, meet different people, explore my own thoughts through writing--you know, take the time to write more, become better at it, better at expression. I think this desire is fundamentally rooted in wanting to be more human; a desire to, in a math analogy, create more connections between myself and other nodes in this existence; other people, other experiences, other entities in general. Spread good vibes
              <br/><br />
              another desire would be the aim at social success. and that doesn&apos;t necessarily mean playing the &apos;typical&apos; status game. a large part of social success, and one I personally focus more on when it comes to this game, is not to actively succeed but to prevent failure; to not fall behind my peers while they enter into certain universities and get certain internships during, get certain jobs after, accumulate certain material wealth throughout.
              <br/><br />
              another strong desire is wealth. fundamentally, that&apos;s really just a means to a desire, but the necessity of it is for my ends is so strong that it&apos;s become a desire in and of itself--when you focus on something for a long time, perspective can be forgotten, and it essentially is an ends in itself due to the way you have to reposition your priorities and values to achieve it
              <br/><br />
              a lot of these desires can converge, and they&apos;re not mutually exclusive--they overlap, but even the word overlap doesn&apos;t accurately describe the relationship between them: it implies that these desires are somehow separate, when actually it&apos;s more like the things that constitute desires form this large cloud, perhaps &quot;ends desired by human nature,&quot; and perhaps what we find ourselves focusing on repeatedly are themes of those constituents of those desires
              <br/><br />
              like, my aim would be to succeed in all two (three) of those desires. but the paths to them may differ. 
              <br/><br />
              I suppose that&apos;s where this conversation really talks about. not so much how do you rectify two different desires, but different potentials which can be used to achieve those desires

            </p>

            <p className="party-two">
              yeah--which worlds do you involve yourself in to get to those ends. the &quot;typical&quot; world? get a high gpa, resume pad, land faang internships, work at fintech, make mid six figures a couple years into your career? 
              <br /><br />
              or do you want to involve yourself in true entrepreneurship? a stab at the complete unknown? as Taleb would call, in the land of Extremistan; 99% fail rate, 1% success, but disproportional success in such event(s)

            </p>

            <p className="party-one">
              yeah. the specificities of my plight are getting quite obvious now lol
              <br /><br />
              this makes me think back to the loose plan I had for my life back in high school-- graduate, get into a good school, take a gap year, build and explore, and start school if nothing crazy came from that year off
              <br /><br />
              I think people would say having a good plan can reconcile all these different mediums and worlds you want to enter to achieve some ends-- if my current state can be represented by a thread that diverges in the middle, a well thought out plan can be represented by threads being woven in together. like a braid. like my plan in highschool

            </p>

            <p className="party-two">
              but plans rarely work out, right?

            </p>

            <p className="party-one">
              yeah, and I&apos;m not someone that&apos;s ever thought to or thought it much useful to plan out to the exact dates of what will happen for the next 10, 15 years of my life. because again, plans rarely work out, and needless to say, the further out the plan, the less robust it becomes just because of the uncertain nature of life. I factored into my plans the &apos;nominal chaos&apos; of existence
              <br /><br />
              but maybe my extreme struggle to study has shown me that not enough nominal chaos was factored in

            </p>

            <p className="party-two">
              why&apos;s that?
            </p>

            <p className="party-one">
              probably, like for always anything in life, a variety of reasons.
              <br /><br />
              but one, perhaps a significant part of the overall reason, is that when you&apos;re presented with some completely unexpected, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, you&apos;re hit with some realization that there&apos;s perhaps another path that you can take that wasn&apos;t ever present in your purview before
              <br /><br />
              and so that would but the current plan in chaos
              <br /><br />
              returning to the idea of different potential mediums to an ends, we already account for that within our plans. so just as the dissonance between those different mediums makes it hard for us to plan exactly what type of medium to take and how, a new path or world opening up--a new potential plan that hasn&apos;t ever been considered--is a dissonance from our current plan to the highest degree: it&apos;s a medium that has never been considered, so it&apos;s likely going to require a right angle turn from our current path

            </p>

            <p className="party-two"> 
              yes
              <br /><br />
              and that really goes back to the dissonance in potential mediums for an ends causing lethargy, or a lack of effort in either one or, more likely, both, plans. when a new plan, a new path, potential, opens up, we have to quickly recalibrate next steps forward, or the inertia from our initial path will have us continue our current trajectory, while another plan that we deem could be just as, if not, and more likely, better to our ends, grows more distant from us. 
              <br /><br />
              and that can make us more absolutely uncertain about our future

            </p>

            <p className="party-one">
              yeah. 
              <br/><br/>
              we still have to explore exactly why one may choose one plan or the other: a 
              conversation of, what exactly do you like to do? what do you have a passion for, 
              what would you work better in?
              And not to mention, the relationship 
              between passion and vision is also very significant.
              <br/><br/>
              but I suppose that is why we have different plans or different mediums to ends in the first place: a compromise. do we take it though?
              <br/><br/>
              maybe for another time. i think ive made enough nonsense for a day
