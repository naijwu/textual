          based in Vancouver, I&apos;m a first-year science <Link href="/undergrad-at-ubc">undergrad @ ubc</Link>
          <br/>when not <Link href="/writing/studying">studying</Link>, I spend time as a developer for <Link href="/nwplus">nwPlus ubc</Link> and building <Link href="/democracy">democracy.so</Link>
          <br/>I have a habit of starting projects randomly (most are small, <Link href="/weekend-projects">weekend projects</Link>)
          <br/>some <Link href="/projects">projects</Link> (more polished than others) include <Link href="https://internetspace.co">internetspace.coðŸ¡¥</Link>, <Link href="https://wordseveryday.net">wordseveryday.netðŸ¡¥</Link>, and <Link href="https://opengavel.app">opengavel.appðŸ¡¥</Link>
          <br/><br/>
          starting middleschool, I delved into web design and built <Link href="/websites">several websites</Link> (for conferences, charities, businesses)
          <br/>I even tried starting a my own web design business in highschool
          <br/>now I just manage a few of them under another sole proprietorship on the side
          <br/><br/>
          these days, I&apos;ve been learning of and building in crypto &amp; web3
          <br/>I&apos;m interested in the financial markets, <Link href="/writing">writing</Link>, and systems/infrastructure design
          <br/>I like to think and create
          <br/><br/>
          I tried using somewhat unconventional but (attempted) intuitive designs for this <Link href="/new">new personal website</Link>
          <br/>but I eventually returned (for many reasons) to text as its primary structure
          <br/>anyways, as a note, the blue links are navigation and the lighter blue links are pages that are still WIP (progress may be forever)
          <br/><br/>
          cheers, and I hope you enjoy your time here
