            mainstream is an experiment lab for servicing internet native communities
            <br/><br/>
            we've closed our pre-seed round (led by Lemniscap, joined by Samsung Next + many amazing angels) to focus on onboarding organizations to the platform
            <br/><br/>
            mainstream client is a modular, end-to-end governance platform for DAOs. Discuss proposals, have off-chain voting (Moloch, Snapshot, etc.), and then on-chain voting (Bravo, etc.) all in a package that makes sense and is efficient
            <br/><br/>
            mainstream pager can notify you (Slack, Discord, email, etc.) based on community events (proposal starting, voting ending soon, etc.)
            <br/><br/>
            pager for protocols gives community core members a convenient way to blast updates to community members
            <br/><br/>
