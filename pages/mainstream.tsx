            mainstream is a modular, end-to-end governance platform for DAOs. Discuss proposals, have off-chain voting (Moloch, Snapshot, etc.), and then on-chain voting (Bravo, etc.) all in a package that makes sense and is efficient
            <br/><br/>
            currently closing our pre-seed round (led by Lemniscap, joined by Samsung Next + many amazing angels) to focus on onboarding organizations to the platform
            <br/><br/>
            medium to long term, we want to offer deep treasury + delegation insight,
            as well as explore metagovernance + cross-chain governance
            <br/><br/>
            exciting!
